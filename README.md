## Hobbic

Hobbic is an iOS app that connects people through local hobby and activity-based groups. Users can discover, create, and join groups based on shared interests such as hiking, board games, sports, crafts, and more — starting with Finland.

## Oulun Kartta
[`📲 Available on the App Store`](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/oulun-kartta/id6742150148?platform=iphone)

Oulun Kartta was built based on Oulun Kaupunki's open data source. The data that shows public services and attractions has a complex structure, which includes 13 categories, and 89 sub categories. The app's goals are to show annotations for places and polylines for tracks on map, by transforming its unique coordinate system to WGS 84, and also to navigate to the destination.

## Oulun Kulttuuri
[`📲 Available on the App Store`](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/oulun-kulttuuri/id6499074694?platform=iphone)

The JSON API for this app was provided by ZoneAtlas open data. Data was prensented in many shapes such as grid, list, vertical and image scrollview. The attractions can also be navigated and viewed on map. Events data were updated until 2023, therefore event tab view is not available anymore on the app.
